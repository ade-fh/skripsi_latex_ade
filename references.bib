   abstract = {When BASCAP commissioned Frontier Economics to do a report in 2011 on the global impact of counterfeiting and piracy, our aim was firstly to build on the seminal work of the OECD to—for the first time ever—undertake a data-based, econometric approach to quantifying the value of counterfeiting and piracy; secondly, we set out to pick up where the OECD left off, by expanding their work to include several categories of counterfeiting and piracy that they did not address. Our findings were somewhat alarming, in terms of the magnitudes, but also the projections of how the problem of counterfeiting and piracy would continue to grow in the years to follow. At that time, Frontier estimated that the total global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods was as much as $650 Billion per year, and projected that this figure would grow to almost $1.8 Trillion by 2015.},

   abstract = {What should copyright holders do about the piracy of digital media? This paper first discusses the causes of piracy, with particular reference to the factors that lead consumers to engage in piracy en masse. Then it explores the consequences of piracy for copyright holders. The final section of the paper builds upon the proceeding sections to look at the different strategic responses copyright holders can adopt to deal with piracy. Given widespread digital piracy in Asia, these insights have particular relevance for the region. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
