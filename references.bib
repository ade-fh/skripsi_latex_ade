   abstract = {When BASCAP commissioned Frontier Economics to do a report in 2011 on the global impact of counterfeiting and piracy, our aim was firstly to build on the seminal work of the OECD to—for the first time ever—undertake a data-based, econometric approach to quantifying the value of counterfeiting and piracy; secondly, we set out to pick up where the OECD left off, by expanding their work to include several categories of counterfeiting and piracy that they did not address. Our findings were somewhat alarming, in terms of the magnitudes, but also the projections of how the problem of counterfeiting and piracy would continue to grow in the years to follow. At that time, Frontier estimated that the total global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods was as much as $650 Billion per year, and projected that this figure would grow to almost $1.8 Trillion by 2015.},

   abstract = {This paper studies the authentication problem of specific pieces of paper using mobile imaging devices. Prior work showing high matching accuracy has used the normal vector field, which serves as a unique, microscopic, physically unclonable feature of paper surfaces, estimated by consumer grade scanners. Industrial cameras were also used to capture the appearance of the surface rendered after the normal vector field based on the laws of optics under a semi-controlled lighting condition. In comparison, past explorations based on mobile cameras were very limited and have not had substantial success in obtaining consistent appearance images due to the uncontrolled nature of the ambient light. We show in this paper that images captured by mobile cameras can be used for authentication when the camera flashlight is exploited for creating a semi-controlled lighting condition. We have proposed new algorithms to demonstrate that the normal vector field of paper surface can be estimated by using multiple camera-captured images of different viewpoints. Perturbation analysis shows that the proposed method is robust to inaccurate estimates of camera locations, and a matching accuracy of 10-4 in equal error rate can be achieved using 6 to 8 images under a lab-controlled ambient light environment. Our findings can relax the restricted imaging setups and enable paper authentication under a more casual, ubiquitous setting with a mobile imaging device, which may facilitate duplicate detection of paper documents and counterfeit mitigation of merchandise packaging.},

Now with the explosive growth of smartphones, the QR Code is also being used in mobile marketing and advertising campaigns as a fast and effective way of connecting with customers and providing end-user content, including Web links, mobile coupons, airline boarding passes, etc. Successful implementation of the QR Code in any of these fields requires a knowledge of certain basic information about both the QR Code itself and the technology associated with it.},
