   abstract = {When BASCAP commissioned Frontier Economics to do a report in 2011 on the global impact of counterfeiting and piracy, our aim was firstly to build on the seminal work of the OECD to—for the first time ever—undertake a data-based, econometric approach to quantifying the value of counterfeiting and piracy; secondly, we set out to pick up where the OECD left off, by expanding their work to include several categories of counterfeiting and piracy that they did not address. Our findings were somewhat alarming, in terms of the magnitudes, but also the projections of how the problem of counterfeiting and piracy would continue to grow in the years to follow. At that time, Frontier estimated that the total global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods was as much as $650 Billion per year, and projected that this figure would grow to almost $1.8 Trillion by 2015.},

   abstract = {This paper studies the authentication problem of specific pieces of paper using mobile imaging devices. Prior work showing high matching accuracy has used the normal vector field, which serves as a unique, microscopic, physically unclonable feature of paper surfaces, estimated by consumer grade scanners. Industrial cameras were also used to capture the appearance of the surface rendered after the normal vector field based on the laws of optics under a semi-controlled lighting condition. In comparison, past explorations based on mobile cameras were very limited and have not had substantial success in obtaining consistent appearance images due to the uncontrolled nature of the ambient light. We show in this paper that images captured by mobile cameras can be used for authentication when the camera flashlight is exploited for creating a semi-controlled lighting condition. We have proposed new algorithms to demonstrate that the normal vector field of paper surface can be estimated by using multiple camera-captured images of different viewpoints. Perturbation analysis shows that the proposed method is robust to inaccurate estimates of camera locations, and a matching accuracy of 10-4 in equal error rate can be achieved using 6 to 8 images under a lab-controlled ambient light environment. Our findings can relax the restricted imaging setups and enable paper authentication under a more casual, ubiquitous setting with a mobile imaging device, which may facilitate duplicate detection of paper documents and counterfeit mitigation of merchandise packaging.},

In this paper, several models are built to cluster capstone project documents using three clustering techniques: k-means, k-means fast, and k-medoids. Our datatset is obtained from the library of the College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh. Three similarity measure are tested: cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Correlation Coefficient. The quality of the obtained models is evaluated and compared. The results indicate that the best performance is achieved using k-means and k-medoids combined with cosine similarity. We observe variation in the quality of clustering based on the evaluation measure used. In addition, as the value of k increases, the quality of the resulting cluster improves. Finally, we reveal the categories of graduation projects offered in the Information Technology department for female students.},

The third edition of this title reflects this shift, with added support for beginners, including selected solutions for exercises and additional example data sets (with code available online). Other substantial changes include discussions of outlier detection; ranking algorithms for perceptrons and support vector machines; matrix decomposition and spectral methods; distance estimation; new kernel algorithms; deep learning in multilayered perceptrons; and the nonparametric approach to Bayesian methods. All learning algorithms are explained so that students can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will also be of interest to professionals who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods. -- Edited summary from book.},
