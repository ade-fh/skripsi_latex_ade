   abstract = {When BASCAP commissioned Frontier Economics to do a report in 2011 on the global impact of counterfeiting and piracy, our aim was firstly to build on the seminal work of the OECD to—for the first time ever—undertake a data-based, econometric approach to quantifying the value of counterfeiting and piracy; secondly, we set out to pick up where the OECD left off, by expanding their work to include several categories of counterfeiting and piracy that they did not address. Our findings were somewhat alarming, in terms of the magnitudes, but also the projections of how the problem of counterfeiting and piracy would continue to grow in the years to follow. At that time, Frontier estimated that the total global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods was as much as $650 Billion per year, and projected that this figure would grow to almost $1.8 Trillion by 2015.},

This paper first discusses the causes of piracy, with particular reference to the factors that lead consumers to engage in piracy en masse. Then it explores the consequences of piracy for copyright holders. The final section of the paper builds upon the proceeding sections to look at the different strategic responses copyright holders can adopt to deal with piracy. Given widespread digital piracy in Asia, these insights have particular relevance for the region. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {This paper studies the authentication problem of specific pieces of paper using mobile imaging devices. Prior work showing high matching accuracy has used the normal vector field, which serves as a unique, microscopic, physically unclonable feature of paper surfaces, estimated by consumer grade scanners. Industrial cameras were also used to capture the appearance of the surface rendered after the normal vector field based on the laws of optics under a semi-controlled lighting condition. In comparison, past explorations based on mobile cameras were very limited and have not had substantial success in obtaining consistent appearance images due to the uncontrolled nature of the ambient light. We show in this paper that images captured by mobile cameras can be used for authentication when the camera flashlight is exploited for creating a semi-controlled lighting condition. We have proposed new algorithms to demonstrate that the normal vector field of paper surface can be estimated by using multiple camera-captured images of different viewpoints. Perturbation analysis shows that the proposed method is robust to inaccurate estimates of camera locations, and a matching accuracy of 10-4 in equal error rate can be achieved using 6 to 8 images under a lab-controlled ambient light environment. Our findings can relax the restricted imaging setups and enable paper authentication under a more casual, ubiquitous setting with a mobile imaging device, which may facilitate duplicate detection of paper documents and counterfeit mitigation of merchandise packaging.},

   abstract = {Shortly, within the member states of the European Union a serializationbased anti-counterfeiting system for pharmaceutical products will be introduced. This system requires a third party enabling to track serialized and enrolled instances of each product from the manufacturer to the consumer. An alternative to serialization is authentication of a product by classifying it as being real or fake using intrinsic or extrinsic features of the product. Thereby, one approach is packaging material classification using images of the packaging textures. While the basic feasibility has been proven recently, it is not clear if such an authentication system works with images captured with mobile devices. Thus, in this work mobile device drug packaging authentication is investigated. The experimental evaluation provides results on single- and cross-sensor scenarios. Results indicate the principal feasibility and acknowledge open issues for a mobile device drug packaging authentication system.},
